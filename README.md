## Grid

it is used to style pages

### How it works

The grid system is implemented with the Grid component:
<ul>
		<li>
        It uses CSS’s Flexible Box module for high flexibility.
		</li>
    <li>
        There are two types of layout: containers and items.
    </li>
		<li>
        Item widths are set in percentages, so they’re always fluid and sized relative to their parent element.
    </li>
		<li>
        Items have padding to create the spacing between individual items.
    </li>
		<li>
        There are five grid breakpoints: xs, sm, md, lg, and xl.
    </li>
</ul>
